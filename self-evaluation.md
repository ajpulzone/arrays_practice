# How confident fo you feel with the content of Arrays so far?
   *I feel pretty good about the concept, though calling different methods (especially new ones) takes me some time and based on a couple intro courses I took sometimes the exact action that a method has is sometimes not precisely what I think it is. In general, I am feeling confident up to this point.

# Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
   *I will continue to practice these exercises (repetition is my friend), and I have been helping a cohort made which has been AWESOME for my learning as well (having to explain something and walk through it multiple times and multiple ways is an amazing learning tool). At this point, even if I am a bit slow, I feel confident in putting all of the pieces together so far.

# What questions for you have about Arrays?
   *If you remove an element within an Array (ex, when using pop), is that element gone from the array forever or is there a way to add it back into the array at a later date?

*I have bookmarked the Arrays document :)*
